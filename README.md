# AI-Powered Personal Document Assistance System

The AI-Powered Personal Document Assistance System allows users to securely upload private documents (PDFs and images) and later retrieve relevant content using natural language queries.
Built entirely on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the system employs a combination of Document AI, Vertex AI, Cloud Run, and BigQuery to perform intelligent text extraction, embedding, and retrieval through vector similarity search.

This architecture ensures data privacy, scalability, and multilingual adaptability by leveraging Googleâ€™s advanced AI models and server-less infrastructure.
